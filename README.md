# example-npm-fastify-proxy
FastiProxy is a lightweight Fastify-based reverse proxy server built with ECMAScript Modules (.mjs). It leverages @fastify/http-proxy to forward HTTP requests to configurable upstream services. This minimal proxy app is ideal for local development, API gateway prototyping, or service mocking in microservice environments.
